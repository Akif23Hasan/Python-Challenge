This Python script analyses the financial records of a company using a dataset called "budget_data.csv". The dataset consists of two columns, "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The script calculates the following values:

1) The total number of months included in the dataset.
2) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
3) The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes.
4) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
5) The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## How to Use
1) Save the "budget_data.csv" file in a folder named "Resources" in the same directory as the script.
2) Run the script using VS code.
3) The analysis will be printed to the terminal and a text file named "Financial_Analysis.txt" will be created in a folder named "Analysis".
